          >, largely due to its reputation for violence and injury. To reduce
          contact-related injuries, the NFL has assembled some of the world's
          best medical teams and has experienced numerous advances in helmet
          technology and safety measures over the past few years.

        <p class="side-container-text">
          However, an equally devastating set of injuries occur without
          player-to-player contact. These
          <span class="bold-text">non-contact</span>
          injuries impact ligaments and bones in players' lower-bodies and are
          often a result of sharp pivots on the playing surface, with recovery
          times spanning from a few days to over a year.

      were among the NFL's premier wide receivers in the 2010s, collectively
      earning 13 Pro Bowl selections and 5 All-Pro selections (the game's
      highest award) between 2011-2017. They altogether amassed 22,877 receiving
      yards and each finished among the

      their careers, these stars exemplify how non-contact injuries can severely
      impact even the best in the NFL.

      A.J. Green missed the entire 2019 season after suffering a
      <span class="bold-text">pedal ankle sprain</span> in training camp prior
      to the season's start, landing awkwardly on his left foot after going up
      for a catch. Green later mentioned being upset with the condition of the
      practice field the injury occurred on.

    <p>
      Odell Beckham Jr. tore his left knee's
      <span class="bold-text">anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)</span>
      while running after a defender who had intercepted a pass in a Week 7 game
      during the 2020 season, missing the rest of the season and requiring
      surgery.

      Dez Bryant fractured the
      <span class="bold-text">fifth metatarsal</span> in his right foot on a
      hard plant in the first game of the 2015 NFL season, requiring surgery and
      a screw to be placed in his foot.

        <h1>The Money</h1>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      The NFL has blossomed into a multi-billion dollar industry, with minimum
      player salaries starting at
      <a href="https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/cba/minimum">$610,000</a> each year
      and extending to

        >$60 million</a
      >
      over just one season. However, non-contact injuries can spell major
      trouble, not only for player performances, but also financially. Missing
      games, retiring early, or failing to sign a large contract extension due
      to injury can be devastating and result in a significant loss of money.
    </p>
    <p>
      An <span class="bold-text">ACL injury</span>, such as the one suffered by
      Odell Beckham Jr., are especially catastrophic as they almost always
      necessitate surgery and a multi-month recovery process.

        There is, however, one potential fix that the NFL can make to lessen the
        prevalence of these non-contact injuries.
        <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #869397">Synthetic turf</span>
        surfaces, often used for their lower maintenance costs, greater
        durability, and ability to enable stadiums to host different events
        (e.g., concerts), make up
        <a
          href="https://en.as.com/nfl/nfl-stadiums-with-real-grass-and-artificial-turf-full-list-of-field-surfaces-n-2/"
          >14 of the 32 NFL teams'</a
        >
        home stadiums. The rest of the teams use
        <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #89a97f">natural grass</span>
        fields. When rolled out for games, synthetic turf can lead to uneven or
        slippery surfaces that become amplified when players are sprinting and
        pivoting at upwards of 23 miles per hour. These turf imperfections have
        real consequences for the athletes who compete on them.
      </p>
      <img class="wider-img" src="images/chart4.png" />
    </div>
    <p>
      By moving away from synthetic turf fields in favor of natural grass, the
      NFL can tackle the growing problem of non-contact injuries.
      <span class="bold-text">
        The NFL should invest in natural grass fields as a committment to their
        players: one almost as strong as the players' committment to the
        game.</span

    <h2>Inspiration and Sources</h2>
    <p>
      This data narrative was inspired by my own experiences playing football in
      high school. Whenever I would tell people about my past playing
      experiences, one of the first questions they would ask me would be about
      how often high-impact injuries and concussions occurred during play. As
      someone who never had high-impact injuries but did suffer two serious knee
      injuries, I was interested in shedding light on these often-overlooked but
      just as detrimental injuries.

      This project was created as the final project for the DATA 1500 course at
      Brown University under the instruction of Reuben Fischer-Baum. The

      Future, which is the NFL's annual Super Bowl competition aimed at
      improving player health, safety, and performance. The 2020 analytics
      competition, from which this dataset originates, specifically includes
      three different CSVs with injury, play, and advanced analytics data of 250
      NFL players over the course of two consecutive seasons. The second
      visualization's yards/game and Pro Bowl selection data comes from Pro
